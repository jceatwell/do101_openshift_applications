== Introduction

Course Objectives:
* Demonstrate basic skill to deploy, update, scale and troubleshoot applications on Openshift
* Demonstrate good understanding of benifits of using Openshift and how to contribute to applications deployed on Openshift
 
== 1. Configuring a Cloud Application Developer Environment

* VSCode + NodeJS + Express used in course

=== 1.1 Enode Express Generator

[source, shell]
----
npm install --save express-generator
npx express-generator
npm install
DEBUG=myapp:* npm start
----

=== 1.2 Developing Applications with Visual Studio Code

Can install on Centos / RHEL using `dnf install vscode`

=== 1.3 Initializing a Git Repository

Can initialize private repo in vscode. Can use repo on left status bar to add to Github (owned my M/S .. how convenient)
Cmd + Shift + P -> Check "git:" commands for staging, cloning, etc. (Also for Initialization of Git Repository)

```shell
cd /path/to/project
git init
git add ./*
git commit -m "add code skeleton"
git checkout HEAD -1      # Previous Commit (Detached)
git checkout master       # Back to HEAD
git add remote origin https://github.com/some/repo
git push -u origin master
git add app.js
```


For Git commit messages in vscode:

```
"[git-commit]": {
    "editor.rulers": [72, 50],
    "editor.wordWrap": "off"
}
```
=== 1.4 Guided Exercise: Initializing a Git Repository

By default on Linux and macOS systems, Git does not manage your remote repository credentials. Git prompts for your credentials each time you connect to GitHub

```
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

Configure details:

```
git config --global user.name yourgituser
git config --global user.email user@example.com
```

In vscode settings, choose Features -> SCM -> Show p[roviders to show all Git providers (Hidden by default)

Initialize Repository, with 'git init' or with command palette > 'git:Initialize Repository'

To add local to remote, use command palette -> 'git:Add remote', with Remote Name == 'origin', Remote URL will be Git https location

== Chapter 2 Deploying applications to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

A container is a way to package an application with all its dependencies, such as runtime environments and libraries.


Advantages:
- Horizontal Scaling
- Automatic scaleout and scale in
- CI/CD
- Continuous upgrades
- Blue/Green Deployments
- Source to Image ?

A container should have all available runtime dependencies to be able to run successfully
A Pod is the basic unit of deployment.

Idea (Build configure Source)

1. The developers commit work to a Git repository.
2. When ready to deploy their code, the developers use the OpenShift web console to create the application. The URL to the Git repository is one of the required parameters.
3. OpenShift retrieves the code from the Git repository and builds the application.
4. OpenShift deploys the application in a pod.

Openshift offers 2 perspectives:
1. Administration
2. Development
